TS Plus Plus
------------

This is a [metamod](http://metamod.org) plugin for [The Specialists](http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-specialists), which was a Half-Life mod. My work with this project was part of why I was given the reigns of The Specialists by the original creator after he lost interest in his project.

This codebase is honestly kind of embarrassing, but it's probably the earliest code I've written that still survives. (There was no such thing as GitHub back then.)

If you want to point out that it's ironic that this source code survived but the TS source code didn't, can it.
